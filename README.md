# Keno
This is a game based on the popular gambling game Keno. This is a maven project.

Runs on Java 11 and uses JavaFX. The rules are avaliable to the player in game, all the player needs to do is hit the 'menu' button on the top left, and then a dropdown menu will pop up. Press 'display the rules of the game' in order to be shown how to play the game.
Download the zip file, extract it, and import it as a maven project.

Thank you, enjoy! :)
